/**
 * Returns a hash code for a string.
 * (Compatible to Java's String.hashCode())
 *
 * The hash code for a string object is computed as
 *     `s[0]*31^(n-1) + s[1]*31^(n-2) + ... + s[n-1]`
 * using number arithmetic, where s[i] is the i th character
 * of the given string, n is the length of the string,
 * and ^ indicates exponentiation.
 * (The hash value of the empty string is zero.)
 *
 * @param {string} s a string
 * @return {number} a hash code value for the given string.
